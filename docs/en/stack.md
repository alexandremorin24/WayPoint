## 📈 Performance & Scalability (Implemented from MVP)

To prepare for rapid adoption and ensure smooth scalability, the following optimizations are directly implemented from the MVP stage:

### 🔍 Database Optimizations (MySQL)
- **Immediate SQL indexing** on critical fields:
  - `owner_id`, `map_id`, `user_id`, `created_at`, `is_public`
- **Server-side Pagination**
  - Implemented on critical API endpoints (e.g., retrieving public maps)

### 🌐 Frontend Optimizations
- **Dynamic POI Loading**
  - POIs dynamically loaded based on user's viewport to enhance performance and reduce server load.
- **Automated Image Optimization**
  - Thumbnails automatically generated via Firebase Storage for efficient image loading.

### 🔄 Real-time Collaboration Optimization (Socket.io)
- **Efficient Connection Management**
  - Handling WebSocket connections robustly, with graceful fallback mechanisms.
- **Notification Optimization**
  - Notifications throttled and batched to optimize real-time collaboration performance.
